*Below is an example of Terraform code to create the reference architecture in AWS as described. This code uses modules and adheres to best practices
*In this structure, the `main.tf` file in the root directory acts as an entry point and references the modules. The `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` files can be used to declare input variables and outputs for the modules.
*This is a basic setup as per given architecture. In a real-world scenario, we might want to consider additional configurations like security groups, route tables, IAM roles, and more, based on our specific use case and security requirements.
*Please review generated 'tfplan.txt' to verify code functionality
